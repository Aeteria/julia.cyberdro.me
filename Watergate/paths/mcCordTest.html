      During James W. McCord's trial, he wrote a letter to the judge describing how there is more to the watergate case than everyone was letting on. He will now testify at the Watergate Senate hearings.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-family: 'Sorts Mill Goudy', serif;">Perhaps you didn't pay him enough hush money, or perhaps he felt that he may as well do the right thing if
    he is going to prison anyway. Either way, this has implicated you in the Watergate Scandal.</p>
